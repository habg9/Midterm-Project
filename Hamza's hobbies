# Hamza's Hobbies


I like to do a lot of things in my free time. 
One thing I like to do is run. For me, running is a great way to deal with stress and it often boosts my mood. It's important not to overdue it though!

Another thing I to do in my free time is Jiu Jitsu. Jiu Jitsu is basically the art of strangling somebody.  I think it's really fun to do and its very exciting when your opponent is good. 4

One quote that I really like is

>Proceed as if success is inevitable.

This really motivates me to do better in Jiu jitsu and when I am running/working out.
